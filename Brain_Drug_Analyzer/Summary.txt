Project Goal: Created a Python module for analyzing drug interactions with addiction and suppression genes across brain regions, based on the research paper "Brain region specific gene signatures in addiction and addiction suppression"
Core Components:

Network analysis module for drug-gene interactions
Brain region-specific gene expression analysis
Suppression/addiction gene ratio calculation


Network Analysis Module:

Created functions to fetch protein interactions from STRING API
Created functions to fetch drug-protein interactions from STITCH API
Implemented network merging to combine gene networks with drug networks
Added functionality to extract first and second-level drug interactions
Created analysis tools to identify addiction and suppression genes in drug networks


Directory Structure:

Set up a proper Python module structure with __init__.py
Organized brain region expression data in hierarchical directories
Created examples directory for demo scripts


Data Organization:

Used pre-categorized gene expression data for 24 brain regions
Structured data with High/Normal/Low expression categories
Implemented loaders for the directory-based data structure


Visualization:

Added functions to visualize drug interaction networks
Implemented heatmap generation for suppression/addiction ratios


Workflow Implementation:

Recreated the workflow from the paper:

Build base network of addiction/suppression genes
Build drug interaction network
Merge networks and extract subnetworks
Map interacting genes to brain regions
Calculate suppression/addiction ratios




Package Management:

Created proper module imports and exports
Set up version tracking



The module now provides a computational framework for analyzing how 
drugs interact with addiction and suppression genes across different brain regions, 
which can help identify patterns that distinguish addictive from non-addictive drugs.
